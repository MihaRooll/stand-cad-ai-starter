# Orchestration contracts (normative)

## Constants

- `MAX_REVIEW_CYCLES=3`; cycle 3 reopens blocker findings only.
- `MAX_PRINCIPAL_ATTEMPTS=2`; second reject → `BLOCKED`.
- Premium packets: max 12 invariants and 12 validation steps (each <=200 chars), `scope_summary<=1000`, max 20 `{path, lines, excerpt<=200}` refs.
- Never send raw shell logs, long stack traces, file dumps, or tool JSON to Sol.

All artifacts share one stable `contract_id`.

**T0/T1:** compact Work Packet (goal, owned paths, verify commands, forbidden) + compact result; formal Task Contract / Plan / Finding / Verification Record **не обязательны**. Main never product-writes T0–T3.

**T2+:** formal Task Contract обязателен; Plan, Finding, Verification Record — когда соответствующий stage запущен.

## Context budgets (best-effort)

| Packet | Max tokens |
|--------|------------|
| Work/Scope Packet | ≤2k |
| L2 Spawn Packet | ≤8k |
| Scout return | ≤4k |
| Final Report | ≤1.5k |

Forbidden in packets: raw logs, full files, chat history, tool JSON dumps. Best-effort in normal Cursor chat — not platform-enforced.

## 0. Work Packet (T0/T1 compact)

Main creates compact Work Packet before spawning implementer:

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
tier: T0|T1
goal: testable outcome
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-1
    text: observable result
owned_files: []
verify_commands: []
forbidden: []
```

Main never writes owned product paths on T0–T3. T0: implementer runs targeted checks (no separate verifier). T1: Grok verifier required after implementer.

## 1. Task Contract

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
tier: T0|T1|T2|T3|T4
goal: testable outcome
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-1
    text: observable result
owned_files: []
verify_commands: []
forbidden: []
```

Writer cannot change acceptance criteria or verification commands.

## 2. Plan (T2+)

Path: `.cursor/plans/<contract_id>.plan.md`.

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
cycle: 1|2|3
steps:
  - id: S-1
    action: bounded action
    owner: operational-orchestrator|implementer|adversarial-reviewer|verifier|principal-arbiter|explore
sol_approved: true|false|null
```

Required before first T3 product write. T2: persist when plan stage runs. Cycle 3 steps cite blocker finding IDs.

## 3. Principal Packet (T3)

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
attempt: 1|2
invariants:
  - id: INV-1
    text: must remain true
validation_plan: []
scope_summary: compact summary
owned_files: []
evidence_refs:
  - path: src/file
    lines: 10-20
    excerpt: capped excerpt
```

Sol response:

```yaml
verdict: approve|reject
gaps: []
```

No implementer before `approve`. Reject on attempt 1 → revise once; reject on attempt 2 → BLOCKED.

## 4. Human Gate Packet (T4)

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
trigger: destructive|external-write|explicit-human
action_summary: requested action
destructive_ops: []
rollback_plan: safe rollback
verify_commands: []
human_decision: null|approve|reject
```

No forbidden mutation before explicit `approve`. After approval, Main owns the exact approved external/destructive action; code-bearing work may enter the reviewed T2 pipeline. Reject → BLOCKED.

## 5. Finding

```yaml
finding_id: F-1
contract_id: task-slug
severity: blocker|should-fix|nit
path: src/file
lines: 10-20
requirement_ref: AC-1|INV-1
evidence: reproducible counterexample
cycle: 1|2|3
status: open|resolved|wontfix
```

Missing `path`, `lines`, `requirement_ref`, or `evidence` → drop finding. Consensus is not evidence.

## 6. Verification Record

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
cycle: 1|2|3
commands:
  - cmd: exact command
    exit_code: 0
    summary: bounded output
criteria_map:
  - id: AC-1
    status: pass|fail
blockers_open: 0
verdict: pass|fail
```

`pass` iff every required command exits 0, every AC passes, and blockers_open=0.

## 7. Final Report

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
tier: T0|T1|T2|T3|T4
outcome: done|blocked|human_pending|failed
changes_summary: compact result
files_touched: []
review_cycles_used: 0|1|2|3
principal_attempts_used: 0|1|2
stop_reason: verified_pass|awaiting_human|blocker_exhausted|principal_rejected|human_rejected|verify_fail_exhausted|invalid_task
```

There is no partial completion. Open should-fix/nit may be reported only when all AC and deterministic checks still pass.

## State transitions

```text
WORK_PACKET -> IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY(targeted)                           T0 implementer targeted checks
WORK_PACKET -> IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY(verifier)                           T1 Grok verifier required
CONTRACT -> [EXPLORE] -> [PLAN] -> IMPLEMENT -> [REVIEW] -> [VERIFY]   T2 conditional stages
CONTRACT -> PLAN -> PRINCIPAL -> IMPLEMENT -> REVIEW -> VERIFY         T3 approve
PRINCIPAL -> PLAN -> PRINCIPAL                T3 reject on attempt 1
PRINCIPAL -> BLOCKED                          T3 reject on attempt 2
CONTRACT -> HUMAN -> HUMAN_PENDING            T4 awaiting decision
HUMAN_PENDING -> BLOCKED                      T4 explicit human reject
HUMAN_PENDING -> IMPLEMENT                    T4 approve + code-bearing task; Main dispatches reviewed T2 pipeline
HUMAN_PENDING -> EXECUTE -> VERIFY            T4 approve + action-only task; Main executes exact approved action
HUMAN_PENDING -> IMPLEMENT -> REVIEW -> EXECUTE -> VERIFY  T4 approve + code/action hybrid
IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY                           T0 targeted or T2 when no separate verifier
IMPLEMENT -> REVIEW -> VERIFY                 T2/T3/T4-approved-code when review stage runs
REVIEW|VERIFY -> IMPLEMENT                    fixable failure, cycle < 3
VERIFY -> DONE                                strict pass gate
otherwise -> BLOCKED|HUMAN_PENDING|FAILED
```

| Condition | Outcome | stop_reason |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Strict verification pass | DONE | `verified_pass` |
| Human decision missing | HUMAN_PENDING | `awaiting_human` |
| Human reject | BLOCKED | `human_rejected` |
| Second principal reject | BLOCKED | `principal_rejected` |
| Cycle 3 has open blocker finding | BLOCKED | `blocker_exhausted` |
| Cycle 3 required command/AC still fails without blocker finding | FAILED | `verify_fail_exhausted` |
| Invalid/unexecutable contract | FAILED | `invalid_task` |

Main creates the Final Report and is the only user-facing completion owner.

## 8. Docs Impact Record

Required when change/build touches docs or user-facing surface (README, onboarding, AGENTS copy):

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
docs_paths_touched: []
docs_map_entries_updated: []
validator_run: yes|no
validator_exit_code: 0|null
notes: compact optional context
```

- `docs_paths_touched`: every doc/markdown path edited or added
- `docs_map_entries_updated`: `entries[].path` values changed in `docs/docs-map.json`
- `validator_run: yes` expected when map or referenced paths changed; attach exit code
- Omit section only for pure code changes with zero doc/user-facing touch

## Verification profiles (normative light vocabulary)

Light scope only — **not** a second oracle engine. Profiles name **which deterministic commands** satisfy verify stages; they do **not** prove Cursor/model/plugin runtime (INV-10).

| Profile | Scope | Typical command (toolkit root) |
|---------|-------|--------------------------------|
| `targeted` | Task `verify_commands` only (owned paths) | Per Work Packet / Contract |
| `Quick` | All fast static/policy checks once | `scripts/verify-harness.ps1 -Profile Quick` |
| `Full` | Quick + exactly one bootstrap oracle | `scripts/verify-harness.ps1 -Profile Full` |

**Authoritative vocabulary (VERIFY-01):** `targeted` / `Quick` / `Full` above are **normative for running** verify stages. The evidence sidecar (`tests/orchestration/evidence-schema.json`) accepts `targeted`, `quick`, `full`, plus `affected` and `checkpoint` — the latter two are **evidence-recording** labels for the shadow sidecar only; they do not create new oracles or override toolkit profiles. Map `quick` ↔ `Quick` when recording.

**Default during change/build/fix:** implementer runs **targeted** checks from the packet; toolkit contributors use **Quick** for local completion. **Full** is due when any Full trigger below applies — deferred Full is **not** done without INV-7 evidence.

### Full triggers (schedule Full)

1. **pre-merge** — PR / merge intent to protected branch
2. **release** — ship, tag, publish, or bootstrap copy to consumers
3. **shared config** — rules, skills, agents, copy lists, orchestration manifests, plugin mirrors
4. **public contract** — contracts, tier-rubric, schemas, or APIs shipped to products
5. **unknown impact** — weak oracle, cross-cutting blast radius unclear
6. **flake** — prior verify failure in touched area or non-deterministic regression signal
7. **explicit request** — human or Main asks for Full

### Due checkpoint (INV-7)

| Phase | Done evidence |
|-------|----------------|
| Until required CI is **active** | Same-SHA local **Full** (exit 0) unless explicit human deferral recorded in Final Report |
| After green `toolkit-verify` on target SHA | May satisfy pre-protection checkpoint only; **report branch protection status** |
| Always | Deferred Full ≠ done without INV-7 evidence |

Protection edits remain Human Gate (T4). Green CI does not replace protection signoff.

### Evidence rules (fixtures-backed policy)

- `verify_commands` name **exact** commands; forbid placeholder "run tests".
- Verification Record maps each command → AC IDs with exit codes.
- Static oracle tokens (`VERIFY_HARNESS_PASS`, `STAGE_OK`) = deterministic evidence only.
- Findings and done claims still require `path + lines + requirement_ref + evidence` — model consensus is not evidence.

Product repos without toolkit oracle: use task `verify_commands` only; do not invent profile names.

## Artifact ownership

| Artifact | Creator | Persistence |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Work Packet | Main (T0/T1) | compact task packet |
| Task Contract | Main (T2+ required) | chat/task packet |
| Plan | operational-orchestrator (T2 when plan stage runs; T3 required) | `.cursor/plans/<contract_id>.plan.md` |
| Principal Packet | operational-orchestrator | compact task packet; no raw log |
| Human Gate Packet | Main | chat until explicit decision |
| Finding | adversarial-reviewer (T2+ when review stage runs) | review return |
| Verification Record | implementer T0 targeted; verifier T1+ when scheduled; Main T4 action-only | verification return |
| Final Report | Main | user-facing response (≤1.5k) |
| Docs Impact Record | implementer when docs touched; Main never product writer T0–T3 | task return when docs touched |

Main never product-writes T0–T3. Only `implementer` writes owned product paths for T0–T3. Verifier/reviewer must not create `_v_*.txt` or temp evidence in product root.

## 9. FailureRecord

Normalized failure for stuck detection and recovery packets. Natural-language progress is not evidence.

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
failure_id: F-1
normalized_signature: stable hash or slug of failure class + command + key output tokens
reproduction:
  cmd: exact command
  cwd: optional path
  exit_code: non-zero int
expected: compact expected outcome
actual: compact actual outcome (capped; no raw log dump)
environment_hash: hash of toolchain versions + relevant env keys (no secrets)
timestamp: ISO8601
```

## 10. EvidenceRecord

Immutable command/path evidence. Model opinion, consensus, or narrative progress is **not** evidence.

```yaml
evidence_id: E-1
contract_id: task-slug
path: repo-relative file (optional)
hash: SHA256 of file or artifact (optional)
command: exact command run (optional)
exit_code: int
base_sha: git HEAD at capture time
summary: bounded output excerpt (<=500 chars)
captured_at: ISO8601
```

## 11. HypothesisRecord

Mechanism under test; duplicate fingerprints must not spawn competing experiments in R0.

```yaml
hypothesis_id: H-1
contract_id: task-slug
mechanism: root-cause claim (<=300 chars)
prediction: falsifiable outcome if mechanism is true
disconfirming_test: command or observation that would refute mechanism
fingerprint: deterministic hash of normalized mechanism + prediction + disconfirming_test
status: open|confirmed|refuted|duplicate
```

## 12. RecoverySnapshot

Point-in-time recovery state; tracks budget consumption.

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
attempt: int
evidence_delta: list of new evidence_id since last snapshot (empty = no new evidence)
duplicate_fingerprints: [H-fingerprint, ...]
remaining_budget:
  evidence_retries: int
  readonly_scouts: int
  experiments: int
  premium_reviews: int
last_failure_signature: normalized_signature or null
```

## 13. ChallengePacket

Bounded recovery handoff for scouts, premium arbiters, or one experiment. Target **≤12k tokens**; no raw logs, secrets, chain-of-thought, or tool JSON dumps.

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
tier: T0|T1|T2|T3
bounded_task_contract:
  goal: compact
  owned_files: []
  verify_commands: []
  forbidden: []
invariants:
  - id: INV-R1
    text: must remain true during recovery
hypotheses: [H-1, ...]
evidence_refs: [E-1, ...]
oracle:
  available: true|false
  description: what counts as pass/fail oracle (null if unavailable)
availability:
  premium_openai: runtime-check|available|unavailable
  premium_claude: runtime-check|available|unavailable
  premium_fable: runtime-check|available|unavailable
scope_summary: compact context (<=1000 chars)
remaining_budget:
  evidence_retries: int
  readonly_scouts: int
  experiments: int
  premium_reviews: int
```

## 14. RecoveryDecision

Closed enum — recovery orchestrator output only; Main remains user-facing completion owner.

```yaml
contract_id: task-slug
decision: retry|scout|premium|experiment|blocked|human_pending
rationale: compact evidence-based reason (<=500 chars)
next_owner: Main|recovery-orchestrator|reproducer|implementer|human
hypothesis_refs: []
evidence_refs: []
escalation_reason: null|uncertain_verdict|evidence_conflict|dual_hypotheses|user_requested_cross_family
budget_after:
  evidence_retries: int
  readonly_scouts: int
  experiments: int
  premium_reviews: int
```

### Recovery budgets (R0)

| Tier | Evidence retries | Readonly scouts | Experiments | Competing worktrees |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| T0 | 1 | max 3 distinct contours | 1 | **none in R0** |
| T1–T3 | max 2 | max 3 distinct contours | 1 | **none in R0** |

- Stuck predicate: same `normalized_signature` **or** empty `evidence_delta`; NL progress ≠ evidence.
- Premium path (T3/security/architecture) — **sequential**, not parallel by default:
  1. `recovery-orchestrator` confirms genuine stuck.
  2. Cheaper evidence first: `reproducer` scratch or readonly scouts when cheaper than premium.
  3. **One** preferred premium arbiter receives the bounded Challenge Packet (at most one premium model per step; `escalation_reason` null/absent).
  4. Second model family **only** when `escalation_reason` is set: `uncertain_verdict` | `evidence_conflict` | `dual_hypotheses` | `user_requested_cross_family` — second call remains **blind** (no peer verdict leakage).
  5. Fable / `deep`: unchanged — explicit `deep` only after unresolved cross-family conflict.
- No reliable oracle → no experiment tournament and no `DONE` from recovery alone.
- Unavailable premium model → degraded-mode record; never silent substitution.
